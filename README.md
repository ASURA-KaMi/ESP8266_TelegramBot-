# Telegram weather|temperature Bot for NodeMCU

The essence of the project is to create a complex capable of real-time monitoring of humidity, air temperature, as well as the content of carbon dioxide in it and transmitting the received values in the form of messages from the bot to your phone / computer via the Telegram messenger.

## Getting Started

Download the project.

### Prerequisites

```
Download the Arduino IDE development environment from the arduino.cc official site.

```

### Installing

Instalation components for NodeMCU

```
路 Install the libraries ESP8266WiFi.h, Thinary_AHT10.h, Wire.h, WiFiClientSecure.h.

路 Assemble the installation on the breadboard, fill in the firmware.

路 On our device, in the Telegram client, write to the bot REM_wet_temp / start.

路 Communicate with the bot using the commands provided to you by the bot himself.

PROFIT !!!
